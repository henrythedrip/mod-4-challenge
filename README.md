## Coding Quiz Javascript

## Description

This is a coding quiz to test your knowledge of Javascript. Please take the quiz and try to score as high as possible. Enter you initials when you are done to be placed on the leaderboard.

## Usage

this is a coding quiz for Javascript. users are able to enter the game by clicking the start button. When start button is clicked a timer starts. Users are presented with a question. When the question is answered another question appears. If a question is answered incorrectly, then 8 seconds is subtracted from the clock. Having a higher score is better than having a lower score. When all the questions are answered then users are able to input their initials. This produces a name in the leaderboard.

Note: No where in the acceptance criteria does it say that the leaderboard needs to be sorted by users times, so I did not add this functionality. I only included functionality that was asked of me, and this was not asked. It simply displays their scores based on which came first.

Please press the reset game button to play another game. Please press the "Reset Score" button to clear local storage (i.e. leaderboard and scores)
